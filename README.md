Prediction with Multiple Linear Regression
Overview
This repository contains two comprehensive projects that demonstrate the application of multiple linear regression for predictive modeling. The projects focus on predicting profit and car prices based on various features and attributes, using datasets from different domains.

Projects Included
50_Startups Profit Prediction
Toyota Corolla Price Prediction
Project 1: 50_Startups Profit Prediction
Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the profit of a startup based on key business expenditures such as R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State.

Solution
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth analysis to understand the relationships between variables and identify key predictors.
Modeling: Developed a multiple linear regression model using the features identified in the EDA.
Evaluation: The model’s performance was evaluated using the R² score, ensuring its reliability in predicting profits.
Business Impact
This model aids startups in making data-driven decisions regarding budget allocation across different departments, ultimately helping to maximize profits.

Project 2: Toyota Corolla Price Prediction
Objective
The objective of this project is to predict the selling price of a Toyota Corolla based on various features such as age, mileage, horsepower, engine size, and other relevant car attributes.

Solution
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized the relationships between car features and their impact on price to identify significant predictors.
Modeling: Built a multiple linear regression model that accurately predicts car prices using the selected features.
Evaluation: The model was assessed using the R² score, ensuring it provides accurate pricing predictions.
Business Impact
This model supports car dealerships and sellers in setting competitive and accurate prices for used cars, enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing inventory management.
